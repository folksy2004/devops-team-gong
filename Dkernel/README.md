First of all, I will like to apologise for stubbornly refusing to create a folder in my name.  There is no known reason for this decision other than the fact that other collaborators in this project prefer Dkernel to Nedu.

This course is designed to introduce the principles, practices and tools that bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. 

At the end of the class, I should have a better understanding of the core concepts and culture behind DevOps. Also,set up version control and collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub. Build and automate CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployments, Containerize applications with Docker and manage them with Kubernetes. Lastly, use monitoring and logging tools like newrelics to maintain and troubleshoot systems in real-world enviroments.
